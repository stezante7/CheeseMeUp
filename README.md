# CheeseMeUp 🧀

CheeseMeUp is a lightweight, Linux-friendly tray app that delivers delightful, cheese-themed compliments every 30 minutes — because everyone deserves to feel 
a little gouda. 😄

**Okay seriously, but why?**

> I wanted to start a new, simple project to test my Linux setup for .NET development.
So I thought to myself: what’s the cheesiest idea I can come up with? 🐵🙈
